  "description": "NOTE Package file fixed, source is in package now - A little encryption keystream, password generation, and tableau lookup distribution centered around Bruce Schneiers Pontifex (or Solitaire) keystream algorithm.  This implementation is more flexible than others online, in that one can variate away from 52 members and use objects instead of letters.
